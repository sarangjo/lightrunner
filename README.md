This is a project by Picotech via StudentRND Labs. We are based on Redmond, WA.
This summer, we messed around with android, and here is our product! We used libGDX for the framework. The majority of
LightRunner was done in java. Because just about all five of us are amateur programmers, we welcome any and all
constructive feedback. We may write LightRunner for Windows Phone, but that remains to be determined. Thanks for visiting!
